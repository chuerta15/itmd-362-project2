Project 2 for ITMD362 - Redesigning University Web Portal

----Ariel Young----

Strength(s): 
  - promote clean code
  - take initiative
  - given a layout, I can deliver the html structure. 

Weakness(es):
  - cannot communicate well when "in the zone"
  - stubborn (must convince me your way is the best)
  - easily distracted
  - artistically challenged (I cannot match colors/styles, 
    usually overkill...which is why my wardrobe consists 
    of 80% black leggings...)
